Pling Business Model Pling is a second-hand bicycle buying and selling platform where individuals and retail shops can list their bicycles. Interested buyers can explore listings, check seller details, and reach out to them directly. For bicycles priced above INR 15,000, we provide an option to ship them at a cost between INR 500-2000. User should always land on the Index/Landing Page, post 2 minutes it should prompt to check his location with a dropdown to select. Integration of tawk.to is also required as the chat option should be available on all pages across for support.

Objective:
Develop a PHP-based website for Pling, an online Second-hand bicycle marketplace, with user-friendly UI/UX, structured bicycle listing, categorized search functionality, and an intuitive seller registration process.

1. Index/Landing Page
Design a visually appealing landing page with a sticky navbar including a global search bar, category filters, and a ‘Sell Bicycle’ button. Ensure users always land on this page. After 2 minutes, trigger a location selection popup. Clicking on login should only trigger a modal if the user is trying to list a bicycle or contact a seller." On the landing page, display a structured grid of bicycle listings. Each listing should show the bicycle image, brand, model, price, and condition badge. Ensure sorting by Latest, Price (Low-High/High-Low), and Relevance. Use AJAX for quick filtering."
Header (Sticky Navbar)
Include the following tabs on landing/Index page:
Global Search Bar
Premium Bicycles
Adult Bicycles
Kids Bicycles
E-Bicycles
Pling! Certified
Location Selector (Dropdown)
Login / Register / User Profile (Should prompt a login modal when clicked only at the end while a seller tries to list the bicycle or customer is clicking for seller contact details)
Sell Bicycle (Sticky Button on the Top Right)
2. Pop-up Trigger (User Location Prompt)
Trigger Condition: Display a popup 2 minutes after the user lands on the website.
Popup Content:
“Select Your Location”
Dropdown listing cities (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, etc.), if selected Mumbai it should show subcategory like Navi Mumbai, Greater Mumbai, Thane, South Mumbai
Selection should allow smooth navigation after choosing the city.

After 2 minutes on the landing page, display a modal with a dropdown asking users to select their location. If a city is selected (e.g., Mumbai), dynamically load subcategories (e.g., Navi Mumbai, South Mumbai). Ensure smooth navigation after selection."

3. Seller Flow – Sell Bicycle Form

When a seller clicks ‘Sell Bicycle,’ open a structured, multi-step form. Step 1 collects bicycle details with relevant dropdowns and validation rules. Step 2 prompts non-logged-in users to register before listing. Ensure AJAX-based submission to avoid page reload." Login should be modal-based and triggered only when needed. If a non-registered user attempts to log in, display a ‘Sign up now!’ prompt. Enable Google and Facebook login options. Ensure validation for all fields."
Trigger: Clicking the Sell Bicycle button should open a structured form with the following fields:
Step 1: Bicycle Details
Category (Dropdown: Children / Adult)
If "Children" is selected → Disable "Cycle Type" & remove "27.5 & 29-inch" wheel sizes.
Brand Name (Dropdown with popular brands + "Other" → Opens a text field)
Model Name (Text input – Allow only Alphanumeric)
Purchase Year (Dropdown – Years ranging from 2000 to present)
Expected Price (Numeric, Minimum: ₹100, Maximum: ₹99,999)

Fields:

Email ID (Validation Required)
City & Sub-City Selection (Dropdown)
Password & Confirm Password
Social Login Options (Google / Facebook)
Logic:

If Category = Children, hide "Cycle Type" & restrict wheel sizes (Exclude 27.5" & 29")

4. Buyer Flow – Bicycle Listings & Filtering

Login should be modal-based and triggered only when needed. If a non-registered user attempts to log in, display a ‘Sign up now!’ prompt. Enable Google and Facebook login options. Ensure validation for all fields."
